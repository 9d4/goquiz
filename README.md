# GoQuiz
GoQuiz is a straightforward quiz application that has been ported from [BayuDC's quiz](https://github.com/bayudc/quiz) and completely rewritten using the Go programming language. It has been developed with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and self-contained functionality. The front-end still the same.

**Build with these in mind:**
- Single Binary: GoQuiz is designed to be compiled into a single binary file, making it easy to distribute and run on various systems without any additional dependencies or installations.

- No Third-Party Database: GoQuiz eliminates the need for external databases. All quiz questions and answers are stored directly within the application itself, ensuring a seamless and self-contained experience.

- Run and Go: With GoQuiz, you can simply run the binary file and start using the application immediately. There's no need for complex setup or configuration processes.
